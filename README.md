# Snake-Game-Using-Python
# Pygame Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Pygame. In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen to eat food and grow. The objective is to grow the snake as long as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the game or itself.

## Features

- Control the snake using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- The snake grows in length every time it eats food.
- The game keeps track of your score, which increases with each food item eaten.
- Game over when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.
- A simple, fun, and nostalgic gaming experience!

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python and Pygame if not already installed.
3. Run the `snake_game.py` script.
4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
5. Try to eat as much food as you can to increase your score.
6. Avoid colliding with the boundaries or the snake itself.
7. Have fun and see how high you can score!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Controls

- Use the **Up**, **Down**, **Left**, and **Right** arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- Press **ESC** to exit the game at any time.
